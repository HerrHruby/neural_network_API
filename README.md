# neural_network_API
A simple API for feedforward deep neural networks

The NN classes are held in NN_api.py. An example
neural network is constructed in main.py (used on 
a binary classification MNIST fashion dataset)

Currently supports the following:
  Loss functions: cross entropy, binary cross entropy,
  MSE
  Activations: sigmoid, ReLU, Linear, softmax
  Optimisers: vanilla gradient descent, momentum

Also includes a tuner for hyperparameter tuning
